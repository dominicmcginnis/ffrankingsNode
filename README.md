Fantasy Football Node
==============
This project is being used to better learn/understand node.js and the various latest UI techniques.  The concept stems from another project/lab, ffrankings, I built when I was working to better understand mongoDb and maven (https://github.com/dominicmcginnis/java-lab/tree/master/ffrankings).

**To run:**
--------------
- Must have node.js installed
- Go into app folder in the command line and run:
    node server.js

**Prototype paths:**
--------------
- localhost:8080 - home page
